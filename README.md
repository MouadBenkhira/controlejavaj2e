# Description

This project is developed as part of the 5th-year engineering program for a Java J2E assignment. The main objective is to create a system for managing orders and products, with additional functionality for monitoring database health and setting limits for operations.

# Technologies Used:

# Backend:

Spring Boot (with Hystrix for Circuit Breaker, JPA for database integration, and Lombok for boilerplate code reduction)
Spring Web (for building REST APIs)
Spring Security (for authentication and authorization)
Spring Starter Mail (for sending emails via Gmail)
Eureka (for service discovery)
MySQL (for the database)
# Frontend:

React (for building the user interface)
# Features:

Order and Product Management: Manage the products and orders effectively.
Database Health Check: Monitor the health of the database to ensure system stability.
Limits on Operations: Set limits to prevent system overload.
Gmail Integration: Send emails through the Gmail service.
Circuit Breaker: Implement Hystrix for service resilience in case of failures.
Service Discovery: Use Eureka for managing service instances.
